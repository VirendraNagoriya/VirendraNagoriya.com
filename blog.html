    <h1>Hello, everyone! My name is Virendra Nagoriya. 
        
        
        I have been passionate about making music for the last two years, after completing my graduation. When I came to Pune after pandemic one of my friends, Saurabh. It was then Saurabh’s idea to enroll in the Neog Camp. I clearly remember the date, which was the 1st of December 2021. And since then I have been working on my coding skills to learn as much as possible and have enough projects to be able to be a part of Neog Camp. It was a short time in which lots of learning and work had to be done, but I kept going and pushed ahead with all the willpower that I had in me to ignite the fire of making it happen. Because deep down I knew this, that, this was the only way to turn my life around. The pressure has been immense but I have been trying to keep myself motivated and strong throughout the process. It has been exhausting, the endless nights of debugging, building, re-building, inspecting but when I see the things I can create on the screen it really makes me feel that it is all worth it. I see how far I have come in the strenuous cycle of learning and it makes me proud that I didn’t give up. Sometimes I wish I had started this earlier but that is not something that will change my present, so thus I keep my head straight while working hard and moving forward, looking towards the bright future that I can make for myself.And i really want to be part of NEOG-CAMP.





        On this journey of mine, my friends and family have shown so much support and love, but I would especially like to thank Mr.Tanay Pratap, whose videos and class materials gave me all the resources to build myself as a coder.
